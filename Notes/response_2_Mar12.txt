If I understand correctly - if I do not then the text needs to explain
better what is plotted - the curves are showing improvements on a
given constraint going from the no-prior case, far right, to tighter
priors included, moving to the left, and each curve corresponds to
priors on a different cosmological parameter. If this is the case then
the label of the curves should be the parameter which has the prior
and the sigma of the pipeline has no meaning for the curve, it could
be added as a vertical line or just reported in the text. In the text
the authors describe the x axis as sigma/param, the sigma_pipeline
should have the same notation to easily compare numbers.

    We decided to remove the values of the pipeline constrains from the labels of the curves, leaving only the parameter
    they refer to.
    We placed the pipeline constraints in the caption text using a consistent notation sigma/param. We tried other options, like the vertical line one, but they tend to make they figure crowded and hard to understand.



Also, why insome cases the curves are above the no-prior level (as in Fig. 3)?

    This is due to the limits of the x-axis we chose. We attached a different version of Fig.3
    that extends beyond the 1% level of external prior and it shows that the curves converge to the
    "pipeline only" value.

    We resctict the x-axis to zoom in into the interesting region of the curves.


I am assuming that the curves have changed compared to the previous
version of the paper because the x axis is different, can the authors
please confirm this?

    The referee is right. The main difference in the new version of the plots is that
    the x-axis is now the external prior as a percent of the value under consideration, i.e.
    sigma_ext(X)/X.
    Before we were using a different, slightly confusing x-axis, simga_ext(X)/simga_pipeline(X)




Minor corrections:

- “Similarly, we vary Neff” -> “We vary Neff” - similarly is a
leftover from the previous version where the authors were fixing Yp.

    Done. Thanks.


- Label Fig. 1 “External Prior” with no “on”

    Done. Thanks.


- “However, an external an external” -> “However, an external”

    Done. Thanks.


- “all-sky CMB experiments” -> “CMB experiments measuring the large
scales” - CLASS is not full-sky for example

    Done. Thanks.


Leftover from previous comments:
- Section IIIA, “since the active neutrino number densities are known
in the Standard Model”, I suggest the authors use the sentence they
wrote in the response, e.g, “considering the robust prediction from
particle physics Standard Model for the number density of active
neutrinos”.

    Done. Thanks.
